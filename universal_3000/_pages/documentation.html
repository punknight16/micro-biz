		<h4>1. Getting Started</h4>
		<p class="lead">This is a simple platform for managing a web businesses</p>
		<p>Start using the application by heading to the login page at "&lt;root&gt;/login". For testing purposes the current version of the application only has 3 users: a <strong>root</strong> user, an <strong>admin</strong> user, and a normal <strong>user</strong>. You can login with any user using credentials provided on the index page. Logging in should provide you with a token_id, a public_key, and a cred_id. These tokens can be used to access all of the functionality provided on the index page, located at "/".</p>

		<p>Once logged in, you can create a <strong>venture</strong>. A venture defines the set of parameters that will prove that your web business has found product-market fit. The <strong>product</strong> is characterized by the amount of content engagement during a particular time frame. Content engagement is an action a user takes on a given piece of content or web page. It sends a signal to the platform that the content was relevant to your audience in some way. The <strong>market</strong> is characterized by audience answers to questions in a particular demographic survey. Product-market fit is achieved by showing that a segment of users that took the demographic survey had engagements with the product during a given time, which resulted in sales.</p>
